# Features

This is an incomplete list of planned features.

- Recursers can sign in via OAuth.

- Recursers can create projects.

- A project can be
  visible to everyone (including non-Recursers),
  visible to Recursers,
  or only to the creator.

- A project has
  a public description (if it is visible to everyone),
  an internal description (if it is visible to Recursers),
  and a private description.

- A project can have any number of tags.
  As with the description,
  each tag has a visibility level.

- The author can indicate if this project was worked on
  before their first batch,
  during their batch(es),
  in between their batches,
  after their most recent batch,
  or any combination thereof.

- A project can have any number of links,
  each with its own visibility level,
  and optionally with a description.

- A project can have any number of images,
  one of which is its "hero" image,
  meaning it is shown on other pages.
  These images can be hosted elsewhere,
  or uploaded to the site.
  If a project does not have any images,
  it can use an image associated with one of its tags as its hero image.

- Each Recurser who logs in has a profile page.
  Recursers can choose how their profile page is shown to non-Recursers,
  including disabling access,
  changing their profile picture,
  and changing their name.
  By default,
  newly created profile pages are not visible to non-Recursers.

- As with project pages,
  a profile page has a public and an internal description,
  as well as links.

- Recursers who associate a profile from another site,
  such as GitHub,
  can use the profile picture from that site.

- Recursers can delete their projects
  and delete their account.

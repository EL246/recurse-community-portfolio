# Goals

Recursers have built some amazing things,
and I want to make it easier to discover them.
The portfolio should show projects
by author,
by batch,
and by topic,
so that browsing is easy and delightful.

Recursers who want to contribute to existing open source projects
should be able to more easily find projects by other Recursers,
to make collaborating less scary and
so that they start with an existing shared experience.

Recursers often reinvent the wheel so that we can learn about wheels,
and it is valuable and educational to be able to
compare our work with previous implementations.
I want to have
a line of Tetris games,
a thread of Zulip bots,
a table of databases,
and a spectrum of ray tracers.

Recursers often write a return statement blog post at the end of their batch.
I want a tool
to make it easier to write that blog post
by showing all the projects they did in their batch,
and I want a tool
that can list those projects for the world to see,
for people who don't want to write a blog post.

Recursers converge in New York,
for one or six or twelve weeks,
and then scatter back across the world.
I want to improve our institutional memory
and foster connections across batches.

# Philosophy

This will be inclusive;
any project which meets
[RC's Code of Conduct](https://www.recurse.com/code-of-conduct)
is welcome on the site,
no matter how small
or messy
or incomplete.

This will be sensitive to user's privacy.
The visibility of a piece of information will be clearly conveyed,
easily changed,
and default to private.

This will be openly and collaboratively developed.
Contributions -
in the form of
issues,
documentation,
code review,
code,
testing,
or anything else - are welcome!

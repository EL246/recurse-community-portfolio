# Recurse Center Community Portfolio

Discover all the things Recursers have built!

The Recurse Center Community Portfolio
is a website dedicated to
showcasing work done by attendees of
the [Recurse Center](https://www.recurse.com).
The collection is inclusive,
meaning that projects which are small or messy or incomplete are welcome,
and it is author-driven,
meaning that it respects authors' privacy and is uncurated.

Read more about the project [goals](docs/Goals.markdown)
and [features](docs/Features.markdown).
